## About Me

Welcome to my homepage! My name is Shuchang Xu 许书畅. It means <i>getting joy from reading</i> in Chinese.

I'm currently a Research Assistant in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at <a href="http://vis.cse.ust.hk/" target="_blank">VisLab</a> of <a href="https://hkust.edu.hk/" target="_blank">the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology</a>, under the mentorship of Prof. <a href="http://www.huamin.org/" target="_blank">Huamin Qu</a>. In my upcoming research, I aim to explore novel interaction and visualization techniques in VR/AR.

Prior to joining VisLab, I'm fortunate to receive inter-disciplinary education at <a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/" target = "_blank">Tsinghua University</a>, where I obtained my master's degree in Computer Science and Technology at <a href="https://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/publication/" target="_blank">HCI Lab</a> supervised by Prof. <a href= "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TZm3-pwAAAAJ&hl=en" target = "_blank">Yuanchun Shi</a>, my first bachelor's degree in <a href="https://www.eea.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/" target="_blank">Electrical Engineering</a>, and my second bachelor's degree in Digital Meida Art at <a href="https://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/publication/" target="_blank">the Academy of Art and Design</a>. Thanks to these diverse backgrounds, I acquired solid experience in several topics that I'm passionate about, including: (1) interaction techniques for visually impaired people, (2) innovative interaction design in AR/VR applications, (3) game design for educational purposes, and (4) real-time rendering in games.

After master graduation, with the aim of applying my mixed skills to creating influential products for social good, I joined <a href="https://www.mi.com/global/about/" target="_blank">Xiaomi Corp.</a> as a product manager. During my two years in Xiaomi, I focused on designing Smart Home Automation products that enable users to unlock the full potential of their smart home. It's fulfilling that our products transform the life of 8 million daily active users worldwide.
